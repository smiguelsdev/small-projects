# Project 01
## Introduction
This is a simple GUI password generator using Python. I want to learn how to use Tkinter and practice basic coding.

## Conclusion
I learned the basics of Tkinter usage, mainly I learned how to read data from things like checkboxes and textboxes.
Pyperclip was also interesting since the copy to clipboard button was a last minute decision.

Honestly I learned a lot and I am satisfied with the result
